# MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA SCIENCE - ENCS5341

This repository contains solutions for three assignments completed as part of the course "MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA SCIENCE - ENCS5341." The assignments cover various aspects of machine learning, including data analysis, regression, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and logistic regression. Each assignment is presented in a structured manner with clear instructions, tasks, and objectives.

## Assignment 1: Fuel Consumption Analysis with Python

The first assignment involves the analysis of a dataset related to cars and fuel consumption. Tasks include loading the dataset, handling missing values, country-wise fuel economy analysis, distribution analysis, correlation analysis, and implementing linear regression using both closed form and gradient descent solutions.


## Assignment 2: Model Selection and Hyper-parameters Tuning

The second assignment focuses on model selection and hyperparameter tuning using polynomial regression and ridge regression. The dataset consists of examples with attributes x1 and x2, and tasks include data splitting, polynomial regression, ridge regression, and model evaluation.

## Assignment 3: Collaborative Machine Learning Project

The third assignment involves a collaborative machine learning project undertaken by a team of two students. The team selected the Dry Bean Dataset and performed tasks such as implementing a nearest neighbor baseline model, evaluating additional machine learning models, tuning hyperparameters, and analyzing model performance.
