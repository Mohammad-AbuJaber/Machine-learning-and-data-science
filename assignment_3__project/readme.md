# Machine Learning Project Report

## Project Overview
This repository documents a collaborative machine learning project undertaken by a team of two students. The project involves the analysis of the Dry Bean Dataset, consisting of images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans, with a focus on classification tasks. The team followed a structured approach, starting with dataset selection and culminating in the evaluation of baseline and advanced machine learning models. The comprehensive report within this repository highlights the dataset characteristics, the baseline model's performance, the rationale behind selecting additional models, and insights gained from analyzing the best-performing model. The repository serves as a comprehensive resource, including Jupyter Notebook providing both code and textual analysis.


### 1. Dataset Selection
- Selected Dataset: [Dry Bean Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset)
- Dataset Characteristics: Multivariate
- Subject Area: Biology
- Associated Tasks: Classification
- Number of Instances: 13611
- Number of Features: 16

### 2. Baseline Model

- Implemented a nearest neighbor baseline model.
- Evaluated performance with k=1 and k=3.
- Reported baseline model results.

### 3. Proposed Machine Learning Models

- Chose two additional models to improve performance.
- Motivated and discussed model selection.
- Tuned hyperparameters for the chosen models (tested at least 4 different values).

### 4. Performance Analysis

- Analyzed the performance of the best model from the previous step.
- Examined instances in the test set where the model exhibits errors.
- Identified interesting patterns in these examples.
