# Fuel Consumption Analysis with Python

This repository contains the solution for an assignment that involves the analysis of a dataset of cars and their fuel consumption using Python. The dataset is provided in the `cars.csv` file.

## Assignment Overview

### 1. Dataset Information
- The `cars.csv` file contains a dataset of cars, and the assignment aims to explore various aspects related to fuel consumption.

### 2. Tasks

1. **Loading the Dataset**
   - Use Pandas to read the dataset and examine the number of features and examples.

2. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Identify features with missing values and determine the count of missing values for each.

3. **Imputation**
   - Fill the missing values in each feature using a suitable imputation method (e.g., mean, median, or mode).

4. **Country-wise Fuel Economy**
   - Determine which country produces cars with better fuel economy using a box plot.

5. **Distribution Analysis**
   - Identify which feature among 'acceleration,' 'horsepower,' or 'mpg' has a distribution most similar to a Gaussian. Support your answer with histograms.

6. **Quantitative Measure**
   - Provide a quantitative measure supporting the answer to part 5.

7. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Plot a scatter plot of 'horsepower' vs. 'mpg' and determine if there is a correlation, and if so, whether it is positive or negative.

8. **Linear Regression**
   - Implement the closed form solution of linear regression to predict 'mpg' from 'horsepower.' Plot the learned line on the scatter plot.

9. **Quadratic Function**
   - Repeat part 8, but now learn a quadratic function of the form f = w0 + w1x + w2x^2.

10. **Gradient Descent**
    - Repeat part 8 using the gradient descent algorithm instead of the closed form solution.
